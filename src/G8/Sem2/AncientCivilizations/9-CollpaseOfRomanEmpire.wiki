= Julio - Claudians (14 A.D - 68) =
- Family of Rulers

Tiberius:: Paranoid, false accused people --> *Lower reputation*

Caligula:: Wanted to make *Incitatus (horse)* --> _*Consul*_

Claudius:: A good *scholar*, too young to handle *pressure*

*Nero*:
- No *respect* for Senate
- Cruel and insane
- Killed *Wife and Mother*
- *Persecuted Jews*
- Committed *suicide* because knew he would be murder

== Peak of Roman Empire ==
Emperors from *Flavian* Dynasty
- Vespasian (69-79)
- Titus (79-81)
- Domitian (81-96)

----

5 *Best*
1. Nerva (96-98)
2. Trajan (98-117)
3. Hadrian (117-138)
4. Antonius Pius (138-161)
5. Marcus Aurelius (161-180)


= Near Collapse 235-284 A.D. =
*20-25* emperors in *49 years*

- Frontiers *weaken*:
    - Lost Romania (Dacia)
- Empire split into 3 parts:
    - 258-275 A.D.

This caused *Claudias Gothicus and Aurelian (Empire Generals)* --> Come in and stablized
Later *Diocletioan (284-305)* created Autocracy.

Autocracy:: No Senate, Emperor had absolute power.

This brought *2 centuries to Roman Empire*

= Final Decline =

- Constantine (306-337 A.D.) *legalized* Christianity in *313 A.D.*
- Theodosius (379-395 A.D.) --> Christianity *offical 391 A.D*

== Splitted Empire ==

{{https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RNvIqIk8c8c/YE67LzKiqiI/AAAAAAAAD0g/gcx_uk6rldsyYTLs9WkPJAWa_Qk5RbB9ACK8BGAsYHg/s0/2021-03-14.jpg}}

- East: *Orthodox Church*:
    - Capital: *Constantinople*
    - Leader: *Patriach*

- West: *Roman Catholic*:
    - Capital: *Rome*
    - Leader: *Pope*

They both helped each other, but had totally different viewpoints.

== Mongul Invasions ==
Monguls invaded --> *West Empire*
Romulus Augustulus *deposed* --> *476 A.D.*

However, the *East Survived (Byzantine Empire)* until _1453 A.D._

= Persecution of Christians =
Orignally --> Rome was *tolerant*

- Incorporated other religions
- Tolerated Jews (Refused to convert)

Rome wants to maintain:
- Order (pietas)
- Favor for Rome

Christianity was a threat to both.

== Issues ==
- Started as a sect
- Some were extremists --> *Out right refused other religions*

== 2 types of Emperor ==
- Reliable --> Keep eyes on Christians but allow:
    - Domitian
    - Diocletian
    - Julian

- Oppressive --> *Nero*
