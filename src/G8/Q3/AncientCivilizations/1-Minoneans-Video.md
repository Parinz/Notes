# Minoans

-   Discovered by **Sir Arthur Evans**
-   First Civilization in Greece _and_ **Europe**
-   They had no written history (_Undeciphered_) -> All determined by **Architecture**

Thus it was divided into four periods:

1. **Prepalatial (Before Palace)** === 2700 BC -> 1900 BC

    - Decentralized Culture
    - Very local

2. **Propalatial (Old Palace)** === 1900 BC -> 1700 BC

    - **Very large palaces**
    - Kings == Social Hierarchy

3. **Neopalatial (New Palace)** === 1700 BC -> 1400 BC

    - Floods wiped out the old palaces
    - **APEX of Civilization**
        - Trade -> _Minoans Pottery_
        - New Competitor -> **Myceneans**

4. **Postpalatial (Final Palace)** === 1400 BC -> 1150 BC
    - The Myceneans took over Minoans

## Minotaur and King Minos

1. King Minos was the King of Crete
2. Poseidon provided him a _bull_
3. King Minos thought he could keep the bull.
4. Poseidon cast spell on King Minos's wife
    - They mate and comes out Minotaur
5. King Minos built a **Labyrinth** to hold _Minotaur_
