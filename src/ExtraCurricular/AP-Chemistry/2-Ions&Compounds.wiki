= Ions =
A normal *Carbon Atom* has:
- 6 Protons
- 6 Neutrons
- 6 Electrons

This carbon atom is *_NEUTRAL_*


----
However when the charges are *not* neutral
it is called an
:: *Ion*!

An Ion has two types:
- *Cation* --> _Positive_
- *Anion* --> Negative

<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> would be called a *Carbon Anion*
<sup>12</sup>C<sup>+</sup> would be called a *Carbon Cation*

- Groups with *low numbers* lose *electrons*
- Groups with *high numbers* gain *electrons*

When a *Potassium Cation + Chlorine Anion* (K<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>-</sup>) bonds, it's called:

:: Potassium *Chloride*
You add *-ide* for the *anion*
(You don't add anything for Potassium since we know it *exchanges bonds*)
