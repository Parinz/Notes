= Ions =
A normal *Carbon Atom* has:
- 6 Protons
- 6 Neutrons
- 6 Electrons

This carbon atom is *_NEUTRAL_*


----
However when the charges are *not* neutral
it is called an
:: *Ion*!

An Ion has two types:
- *Cation* --> _Positive_
- *Anion* --> Negative

<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> would be called a *Carbon Anion*
<sup>12</sup>C<sup>+</sup> would be called a *Carbon Cation*

- Groups with *low numbers* lose *electrons*
- Groups with *high numbers* gain *electrons*

When a *Potassium Cation + Chlorine Anion* (K<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>-</sup>) bonds, it's called:

:: Potassium *Chloride*
IMPORTANT: You add *-ide* for *_ALL_* the *anions*
(You don't add anything for Potassium since we know it *exchanges bonds*)

= Covalent Bonds: Molecule =
Formed when two atoms share electron.

--> Forms a *Molecule* and can be represented by:

== Chemical Formulas ==
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>

A molecule of *Acetic acid*:
- 2 Carbon
- 4 Hydrogen
- 2 Oxygen 

However it could also be written as:
CH<sub>3</sub>COOH

== Structural Formulas ==
Gives a sense of *structure*

- The left one
	- 2D approach
- The right one
	- 3D approach
	- *Dashed indicates is at the back*
	- *Bold wedge == At the front*
	- The other is off to the side

Arrangement known as *_trigonal pyramidal_*


= Ions and Ionic Bond =
Atoms ---> Ions | *Gains or Lose Charge*

In an *Ionic Bond* they *don't share* electrons:
- One atom will take the other's electron
- One --> Postive
- 2nd --> Negative

Results in a strong attraction

The : around Cl means the *electrons*
However, Ionic Bonds *do not* exist in molecules, this is what they look like:

*Ionic Bonds exist in _formula units_*
