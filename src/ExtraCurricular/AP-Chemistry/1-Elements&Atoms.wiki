= Elements =
The smallest part of something that still is *that something*

- The number on top is the *Protons*
- Number on the bottom is the *Atomic Mass (_u_)*

= Atoms =
Elements are made of even more fundamental things which are *atoms*

- Protons = Positive Charge
	- *Can't* change
- Neutrons = Neutral Charge
	- *Can* Change
- Electrons = Negative Charge
	- *Can* Change

		If Proton is changed, the element changes
		If Neutron or Electron is changed the *Isotope* changes

= Atomic Mass Unit / Unified Atomic Mass=
It is another measuring system

1_u_ = 1.660540 x 10<sup>-27</sup>

1 Proton ≈ 1_u_
1 Neutron ≈ 1_u_
1 Electron - *Too small*

== Isotopes ==
Take a look at the Hydrogen Atom it's mass is 1.0008

- 1 Proton
- 1 Electron

*Many versions of these exists*, different versions are called *Isotopes*

So a hydrogen with 1 Proton, 1 Neutron, and 1 Electron exists.
_u_ ≈ 2

----
The number on the bottom is actually all the *Weighted Mass of All Isotopes*

- Isotope 1 exists 80% in the environment and has a weight of 5_u_
- Isotope 2 exists 20% in the environment and has a weight of 6_u_

	 0.8(5_u_) + 0.2(6_u_) = 5.2
	 
Average Atomic Mass:: Weighted Mass of All Isotopes

= Avogadro's Number =
If you wanted to turn:

6.94_u_ of Lithium -------------> 6.94_g_ of Lithium

To do this you do *6.022 x 10*<sup>-23</sup>
That number is Avogadro's number

= Mole =
A mole is a representation of the *Avogadro's number*

1 Mole of Lithium is = 6.022x10<sup>-23</sup> LI

In this case a Mole of Lithium is 6.94g
