== Procedures ==
1. Observation
2. Ask a question --> *Why*?
3. Hypothesis --> *Testable Explanation*
4. Make a prediction:
	1. If *X* is true, *Y* must be true.
5. Design and Test
6. *Iterate and Improve*

*The Key is _REPRODUCIBILITY_*

== Controlled Experiments ==
Are the experiments that are used in step 5.

The experiments have to follow like this
	- Control and Experiment *Groups*
	- Independent and Dependent Variables
	- All other variables be *controlled* 

=== Groups ===
- *Experiment Groups*
	- These are for testing out the hypothesis
	- EG: New Drug

- *Control Groups*
	- This group is for comparison to the Experiment Groups
	- EG: Old Drug

=== Independent and Dependent Variables ===
- *Independent Variables*
	- Variables that are *tested and will affect other variables*

- *Dependent Variables*
	- Variables that are *affected by the independent variables and are measured*

=== Sample Size ===
Ideally it is good to use a *large sample size and repeat many times*
