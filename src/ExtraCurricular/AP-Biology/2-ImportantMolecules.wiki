= Carbohydrates =
*Carbon* + *Hydrogen and Oxygen _same ratio as in water_*
:: Glucose

		Also called *Saccharide* --> Sweet
----
Main Function:
- Energy Source
- Structure


== Glucose ==
:: A Monomer

Glucose can be:
- Independent
- Part of something:
	- --> *Mono saccharide*

They can form to be part of something bigger:
Monomers --> Inside *Polymers*

EG: Glucose --> *Glycogen (Polymer/Polysaccharide)*


= Proteins =
*Macromolecules* that functions as:
- Structure
- Mechanical Purposes
- Enzymes
- Immune System helpers
- Signaling


== Amino Acids ==
Monomers of Proteins

Many Amino acid ---> *Polypeptide Chains* ---> Proteins.

----

= Lipids =
Molecules that are *not* water soluble...
Ex: *Fats*

It has parts that are:
- Hydrophilic:: Likes water
- Hydrophobic:: Does not like water

Allows them to function in a *special way*:
- Hydrophilic outside
- Hydrophobic inside

Other *functions*:
- Energy
- Signaling
- _*Membrane*_
