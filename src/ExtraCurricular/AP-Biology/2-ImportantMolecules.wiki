= Carbohydrates =
Function: Quick *short-term energy*

*Carbon* + *Hydrogen and Oxygen _same ratio as in water_*
:: Glucose

		Also called *Saccharide* --> Sweet
----
Main Function:
- Energy Source
- Structure


== Glucose ==
:: A Monomer

Glucose can be:
- Independent
- Part of something:
	- --> *Mono saccharide*

They can form to be part of something bigger:
Monomers --> Inside *Polymers*

EG: Glucose --> *Glycogen (Polymer/Polysaccharide)*


= Proteins =
*Macromolecules* that functions as:
- Structure
- Mechanical Purposes
- Enzymes
- Immune System helpers
- Signaling


== Amino Acids ==
Monomers of Proteins

Many Amino acid ---> *Polypeptide Chains* ---> Proteins.

----

= Lipids =
(Don't confuse with *Carbohydrate*)

Function: *Long-term energy*


Molecules that are *not* water soluble...
Ex: *Fats*

It has parts that are:
- Hydrophilic:: Likes water
- Hydrophobic:: Does not like water

Allows them to function in a *special way*:
- Hydrophilic outside
- Hydrophobic inside

Other *functions*:
- Energy
- *Signaling*
- _*Membrane*_

= Nucleic Acids =
In "Nucleus" of cells and have *Acidic* properties.

Ex: *Deoxyribonucleic acid* --> *Polymer*

== Nucleotides ==
*Monomers* that make up nucleic acids.

They are made out of:
- Phosphate Group:
	- *Acidic*
- Ribose (*Sugar*)
- Nitrogen Base:
	- *Basic*

{{https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/DNA_Structure%2BKey%2BLabelled.pn_NoBB.png/1280px-DNA_Structure%2BKey%2BLabelled.pn_NoBB.png}}

== Deoxyribonucleic Acid ==
Phosphate + Ribose == *Backbone of DNA*

Nitrogenic Base == Helps forms the *rungs of the ladder*

- Nitrogenic Bases has different *nitrogen bases* that correspond to each other:
	- *Adenine - Thymine*
	- *Guanine - Cytosine*

----

= Minerals and Vitamins =
- Things that body needs but can't produce.

== Vitamins ==
*Organic (has carbon)* things that the body can't produce.

Some Vitamins are *water soluble*:
- *C* --> Stay in body *shorter*.

Some Vitamins stay in *fat soluble*
- *A, D, E, K* --> Stay in body *longer*

== Minerals ==
Inorganic and are often *elements*

Example:
P:: ATP

Ca:: Muscle Contraction

K:: Nerve Signaling

Magnesium (Mg):: Muscle Contraction

== Foods ==
- Often have both *minerals and vitamins*

EG:
- Carrots:
	- Vitamin: *Beta-Carotine* --> Becomes Vitamin A
		- Helps improve eyesight
	- Mineral:
		- Potassium

- Oranges:
	- Vitamin: *C* --> Improves Immune System

- Milk:
	- Vitamin D
	- Calcium

== Conclusion ==
Vitamins --> *Co-enzymes* --> Help do cell *life functions*

Minerals --> *Everything* --> ATP, Bones, Nerves, Etc
