<li>
Walking to the City, Riding a Horse, and Going the Oxcart.

<li>
The towns were small and local, almost everyone in the town knew each other.

<li>
I think that it's very funny. A samurai is supposed to be <span id="Answers-tough, and unbreakable"></span><strong id="tough, and unbreakable">tough, and unbreakable</strong>. These Samurai fought countless of soliders, sometimes with bare hands, yet they succumb to an Oxcart.

<li>
All of them were willing to <em>cut corners</em> to do something.

<li>
If they had been discovered, they would've been stripped of their samurai status and faced servere punishment. However, this time the samurai received sickness from the road bumps as their punishment.

<li>
It taught them that they shouldn't try to cut corners and break rules.
